            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>You knovv vvhat I vvould. That of 88 That of Novemb. 5. This late happy Pacification.</p>
            <p>That learned &amp; holy Lord Bishop, af ChicheÅ¿ter Bp.

And in the <hi>FrontiÅ¿pice</hi> of that Booke (as I remember) he hath Å¿ett the Portraitures, of <hi>Q.

Nov. 5.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I verily beleiue, if the Reverend Father had lived to Å¿ee this day: He vvould have a founde a roome for <hi>king CHARLES</hi> too (our moÅ¿t Gracious Å¿overaigne) vvith his <hi>Flagg</hi> in His hand like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vviÅ¿e. Wherein should have bin expreÅ¿Å¿ed thoÅ¿e late vnhappy Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations in Brittaine, and this moÅ¿t happy Reconciliation con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
            <p>It vvill be too greate an Expence of Time to diÅ¿play the firÅ¿t of theÅ¿e <hi>Banners.</hi> You cannot be ignorant of it. It vvere only to be vvished, It had Å¿omevvhat a fresher varnish. It begins to grovv Å¿o old, that it is too much vvorne out of our memorys. But it muÅ¿t be acknovvledged, to the vvorlds end, That, it vvas one of Gods <hi>greate things</hi> done for our Island. When Å¿uch a <hi>Navy</hi> named the <hi>Armado,</hi> Sirnamed <hi>Invincible:</hi> shall Å¿o Å¿uddainely, Å¿o eaÅ¿ily be diÅ¿Å¿ipated, be defeated.</p>
            <p>I have much a doe to let it paÅ¿Å¿e vvishout an Hallelujah. Me thinks, It runns vpon <hi>Eights</hi> of it Å¿elfe, on purpoÅ¿e for a <hi>Song.</hi> Lord vvhat <hi>greate things didÅ¿t thon then doe</hi> for that thy bleÅ¿Å¿ed Servant, and Her Realme! vvhen Thou Å¿eemed'Å¿t to Å¿uffer the <hi>Å¿ea and Windes to obey Her,</hi> as if they had taken Pay vnder her.</p>
            <pb n="13" facs="tcp:20498:9" rendition="simple:additions"/>
            <p> But there is a nevver, fresher Flagg, (King JAMES His) vvhich deÅ¿ireth rather to belooked vpon, as it tells vs of a <hi>later</hi> &amp; <hi>greater</hi> Deliverance. That of Novemb. 5.</p>
            <p>The former vvas from an InvaÅ¿ion of a forraine Enemy, and (if you vvill,) of a cruell proude one, therefore noe leÅ¿Å¿e could be expected from Them. I vvould allmoÅ¿t all ChriÅ¿tendome, and the Indys to boote, did not Å¿vveate and bleedeâUnder Their InÅ¿o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency. But This (vve are novv to Å¿peake of) vvas from a Dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Å¿tick ConÅ¿pirancy. All the Actors our ovvne Coungion is Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men, our Fellovv Subjects, till TreaÅ¿on &amp; Rome (vvhoÅ¿e Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion) had diÅ¿Å¿olved that <hi>vinculum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A ConÅ¿piracy it vvas, vvhich noe Age can parallell, and vvhich (but for its Annuall Commemoration) vvould be thought by PoÅ¿terity, to be all to geather incredible.</p>
            <p>A ConÅ¿piracy, vvherein Malice vvas armed vvith Fortitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, Fortitude animated vvith Policy, Policy masked vvith Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, Secrecy inveÅ¿ted vvith Religion. They counterfeited, the <hi>Broade Seale</hi> of Heaven, and vvould have it rati-fied vvith a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament: Lord! vvhat Preparations vvere there vvhat a Brevving of death (it is a BP<hi rend="sup">s</hi> expreÅ¿Å¿ion) vvas tunned vp in thoÅ¿e barrells. Povvder, Billets, Barrs, and I knovv not vvhat Å¿tore of Hellish proviÅ¿ion, as if they had meaned to have made an Earth-quake throughout the vvhole, Island. What ayled ye, O ye Sonns of the Cole! What mean't ye, O ye Fire-brands, and Granados of Hell (Pardon me, I cannot be vncharitable vnles Repentance came af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) vvhat meant ye I Å¿ay? Was it your purpoÅ¿e to Trans-late, the king, his nobles and the vvhole Å¿tate repreÅ¿entative, to transla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>te, them all into Heaven in an InÅ¿tant, by an Extemporary Martyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome? Was it your meaning preÅ¿umptuously to prevent a ReÅ¿ur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and to preferre Companions to Elias in fiery Charriots?</p>
            <p>A ConÅ¿piracy, vvherein, all the Crueltys that have bin heard of, or can be Imagined vvere mett to geather, as our late Greate <hi>&amp; Good L. Bishop of WincheÅ¿ter</hi> vvell obÅ¿erved. The Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty of <hi>Pharoh &amp; Herod,</hi> murdering, the harmeles, Innocent,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:20498:10"/>harmeles Infants and yet they Å¿pared the mothers. The Cruelty of <hi>EÅ¿au</hi> killing the mothers vvith the Children; The cruelty of <hi>Nebuzaradan</hi> not Å¿paring the King, and his Nobles, The Cruelty of <hi>Haman</hi> not Å¿paring <hi>EÅ¿ther</hi> &amp; her Ladys. The Cruelty of <hi>Edom,</hi> not Å¿paring the Sanctuary and its vvalls. <hi>Dovvne vvith them, Dovvne vvith them</hi> to the very ground: Or rather <hi>vp vvith them vp vvith them</hi> into the higheÅ¿t Region of the Aire.

And vvas not the Deliverance from this a <hi>greate thing?</hi> that Å¿o diÅ¿mall a Calamity should be praevented by the vnridling of an <hi>aenigmaticall letter</hi> directed to a freind? A <hi>Letter in</hi> deede vvich in the event did <hi>Å¿alutem plurimam dicere</hi> brought moÅ¿t happy Å¿alutations to the vvhole Church and Å¿tate: But vve muÅ¿t thanke (next Allmighty God) King <hi>JAMES.</hi> Of vvhom it might be better Å¿aid, then once it vvas of a greate Orator <hi>MiÅ¿erum eÅ¿Å¿et eum tacuiÅ¿Å¿e</hi> It had bin a miÅ¿erable thing if He had held his peace.

            <p>Here I might vvell take leave to make a ReviÅ¿all of vvhat hath bin Å¿poken concerning <hi>Sions</hi> Deliverance: and compare this of ours vvith that of Theirs both for <hi>Matter &amp; Manner,</hi> that Å¿o the Praeeminency of ours may more manifeÅ¿tly appeare.

            <p n="1">1. For the Matter.
